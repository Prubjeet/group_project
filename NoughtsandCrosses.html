  <h1>Noughts and Crosses</h1>
  <P>Malorie Blackman’s book is written from two different perspectives (Callum’s and Sephy’s) and their experience of their entwined but very different worlds.
</P>
<p>The novel describes an alternative history in which African people had gained a technological and organizational advantage over the European people, rather than the other way around, with Africans having made Europeans their slaves.
</p>
<p>It has been voted as one of the UK's best-loved books, a seminal piece of YA fiction; and a true modern classic.</p>
